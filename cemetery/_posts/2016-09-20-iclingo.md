summary: An incremental version of clingo.

iclingo is an incremental ASP system implemented on top of clingo 3.
It is based on the idea that the grounder as well as the solver are implemented in a stateful way.
Thus, both keep their previous states while increasing an incremental parameter.
As regards grounding, at each incremental step, the goal is to produce only ground rules stemming from the current program slice, without re-producing previous ground rules.
The ground program slices are then gradually passed to the solver that accumulates ground rules and computes answer sets for them.

([version 3.x](https://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/iclingo/),
[version 2.x](https://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/gringo/),
both superseded by  [clingo 4](/clingo/))
