asprin is a general framework for qualitative and quantitative optimization in ASP that allows:
* computing optimal stable models of logic programs with preferences, and
* defining new preference types in a very easy way.
Some preference types (`subset`, `pareto`, ...) are already defined in `asprin`'s library,
but many more can be defined simply writing a logic program.
