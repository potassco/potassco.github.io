# Getting Started

Answer Set Programming (ASP) offers a simple and powerful modeling language to solve combinatorial problems.
With our tools you can concentrate on an actual problem, rather than a smart way of implementing it.
[Get started!](/doc/start/)

To get a quick first impression, you may want to experiment with [running clingo](/clingo/run/) in your browser.

# Documentation

A comprehensive documentation of our software can be found in the [Potassco guide](https://github.com/potassco/guide/releases/).
For additional resources, see the [documentation](/doc/) page.

# Systems

To find out more about a specific system and a download link, follow one of the links below.

* [clingo](/clingo/) is an ASP system to ground and solve logic programs.
    * [gringo](/clingo/) is a grounder (powering the grounding in clingo).
    * [clasp](/clasp/) is a solver (powering the search in clingo).
* [clingcon](/clingcon/) extends clingo with constraint solving capabilities.
* [aspcud](/aspcud/) is a solver for package dependencies.
* [asprin](/asprin/) is a general framework for qualitative and quantitative optimization in ASP.
* [clingraph](/clingraph/) is a tool for visualizing answer sets.
* [clinguin](/clinguin/) is a tool for creating User Interfaces in ASP.

# Development

The source code of our projects is available on [github.com/potassco](https://github.com/potassco/).
Legacy code can be found in the subversion repository on [sourceforge.net/p/potassco/code](https://sourceforge.net/p/potassco/code).

# Labs

The [Labs](/labs/) suite comprises programs related to Answer Set Programming.
These are either small utilities or projects in an early or unfinished development phase.
