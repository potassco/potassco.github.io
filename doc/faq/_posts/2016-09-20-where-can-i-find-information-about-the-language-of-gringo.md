title: Where can I find information about the language of gringo?
---
- The [Potassco Guide](https://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/guide/) contains a complete (informal) language description with many examples.
- The [Abstract Gringo](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/papers/AG.pdf) paper formally defines syntax and semantics of a large subset of the gringo language.
- The [ASP-Core-2](https://www.mat.unical.it/aspcomp2013/files/ASP-CORE-2.03b.pdf) standard, a subset of the language of gringo.
