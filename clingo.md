Current answer set solvers work on variable-free programs.
Hence, a grounder is needed that, given an input program with first-order variables, computes an equivalent ground (variable-free) program.
gringo is such a grounder.
Its output can be processed further with [clasp](/clasp/), [claspfolio](/labs/claspfolio/), or [clingcon](/clingcon/).

clingo combines both gringo and clasp into a monolithic system.
This way it offers more control over the grounding and solving process than gringo and clasp can offer individually - e.g., incremental grounding and solving.

Both clingo and gringo are released together in one package.

**Attention!** The languages of clingo 3 and 4 are not fully compatible because clingo 4 adheres to the recent [ASP language standard][aspcore].
For processing legacy encodings, we recommend downloading the latest version of clingo 3 in addition to clingo 4.
The language did not change in version 5 but there were many API changes.

# Download

- Recent clingo releases are on GitHub: [github.com/potassco/clingo/releases][clingo-releases].

# Packages

The easiest way to obtain Python enabled clingo packages is using [Anaconda][conda].
Packages are available in the [Potassco channel][conda-channel].
First [install either Anaconda or Miniconda][conda-install] and then run

    conda install -c potassco clingo

or

    conda install -c potassco/label/dev clingo

to install the latest development version of clingo.

We also provide pip packages for Python. Once clingo-5.5 has been released,
packages can be installed from [pypy.org](https://pypi.org/user/kaminski/):

    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade clingo

Development packages can already be installed from [test.pypy.org](https://test.pypi.org/user/kaminski/):

    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ clingo-cffi

Packages for clingo are available for some Linux distributions:
- [Debian][package-debian],
- [Ubuntu PPA][package-ubuntu], and
- [Arch Linux][package-arch].

For Mac OS X, clingo packages are available in
- [homebrew][package-brew], and
- [macports][package-macports].
