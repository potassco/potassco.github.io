summary: A general framework for qualitative and quantitative optimization in answer set programming.
---

asprin is a general framework for qualitative and quantitative optimization in ASP that allows:
* computing optimal stable models of logic programs with preferences, and
* defining new preference types in a very easy way.
Some preference types (`subset`, `pareto`, ...) are already defined in `asprin`'s library,
but many more can be defined simply writing a logic program.

For a formal description of asprin, please read our [paper](http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/wv/pdfformat/brderosc15a.pdf) ([bibtex](http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/wv/bibtex/brderosc15a.bib)).

Starting with version 3, asprin is documented in the [Potassco guide](https://github.com/potassco/guide/releases/).
Older versions are documented in the [Potassco guide on Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/guide/).
