summary: Encodings implementing complex optimization criteria via meta programming.
permalink: /labs/metasp/

The metasp encodings are maintained within the [clingo project](/clingo/) in
the
[examples/reify/](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/tree/master/examples/reify/)
folder. This page is kept for reference.

The metasp project comprises a set of encodings that allow for handling complex optimization criteria, e.g., inclusion-based minimization or Pareto efficiency.
For solving, the Potassco tools [gringo](/clingo/) 3 and [clasp](/clasp/) 3 (previously [claspd](/cemetery/claspd/)) are used.
