claspfolio is a portfolio solver for ASP that makes use of machine-learning techniques for performing algorithm selection, choosing among different configurations of clasp.

In 2009, claspfolio was the best single-system solver in the global ranking of the [Second ASP Competition](http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/events/ASP-competition/Results.shtml).

In 2011, claspfolio was the best single-system solver in the NP track and second place in the global ranking of the [Third ASP Competition](https://www.mat.unical.it/aspcomp2011/).
