# What is *asprilo*?

**asprilo** is an benchmarking framework to study typical scenarios in intra-logistics and warehouse
automation with multiple mobile robots. It offers a concise specification of this problem domain
accompanied by a set of tools to generate benchmark instances, verify plans, as well as visualize
both instances and plans. Due to the diverse and complex nature of this domain, asprilo offers an
ideal test bed not only for modern industrial scenarios but complex dynamic problems in
general. Although, the implementation of asprilo relies on [answer set programming
(ASP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming) and Python, it also supports any other
approach that complies with its fact-based I/O interface.
