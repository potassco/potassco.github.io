inca is a prototypical constraint answer set programming system.
Like [clingcon](/clingcon/), it extends the modelling language of ASP with constraints over finite domain integer variables.
Unlike clingcon, inca adopts lazy nogood generation to fully integrate constraint propagation into conflict-driven learning.

A preliminary version of inca was implemented as preprocessing.
It offers various options leading to (non-ground) enodings that can be grounded by [gringo](/clingo/).
