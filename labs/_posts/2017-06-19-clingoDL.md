summary: clingo[DL] extends clingo with difference logic solving capabilities.
---

The system clingo[DL] provides a seamless way to integrate a subset of the theory of
linear constraints, namely Quantifier-Free Integer Difference Logic (QF-IDL), into
ASP. It deals with constraints of the form x-y<=k, where x and y are integer
variables and k is an integer constant. Despite its restriction, QF-IDL can be used to
naturally encode timing related problems, e.g., scheduling or timetabling, and pro-
vides the additional advantage of being solvable in polynomial time. Syntactically,
a difference constraint x-y<=k is represented by a difference constraint atom of
the form `&diff {x-y} <= k`.
